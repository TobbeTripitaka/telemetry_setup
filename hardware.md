# Hardware


## Edge Computer

After comparing several models, I chose the **Shuttle SPCEL03**. It includes **RTC power-on** support in the BIOS and several **I/O ports**, although I haven’t been able to get all of them working under Linux yet.  
I’d be happy to hear any suggestions for improving compatibility.

## Starlink Mini

In the Starlink app, **turn off the snow-melting feature** to reduce power consumption.

The unit can be mounted inside the **Pelican case**. I removed one layer of foam mainly to create more space — the plastic seems quite transparent to satellite signals.

## Pelican Case

The case provides ample room for the computer, relay, and other components.  
Next-generation builds will likely use a smaller design.

## Relay

After testing several models, I selected this **solid-state relay** for its reliable performance and solid specifications. A cheaper alternative would likely work as well.
